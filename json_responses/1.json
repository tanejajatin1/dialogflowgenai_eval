In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, which provides charity, social work and education.[7] Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India, and the most successful missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world. He was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[14] He is now widely regarded as one of the most influential people of modern India and a patriotic saint. His birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.[15][16]",

He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk.

Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous speech beginning with the words: \"Sisters and brothers of America ...\" while introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as \"an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament\".[12]",
